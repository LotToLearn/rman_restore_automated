<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Hi, this is a collection of bash scripts designed to automate a rman and restore migration between two hosts on NFS. It's been thoroughly tested as working on 12.1. The general idea is that you have a **varibales text file that you must fill out**, and then the script sources that for the information.



### Built With

* [BASH](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/Bash-Beginners-Guide.html)

### Platform
* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.8 (Maipo)](https://access.redhat.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You're going to need **two seperate database servers, and a shared NFS.**
I used **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure** to provision mine, so I would suggest using OCI.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lottolearn/rman_restore_automated.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
